# Composition1
A simple study in algorithmic composition

Written in the fall of 2013, this was my first programming project. Serving as a simultaneous introduction to programming, algorithmic composition, and computer music, this project was supervised by Dr. Van Stiefel at West Chester University during my first semester of graduate studies in music composition.
